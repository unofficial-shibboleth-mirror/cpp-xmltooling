     * Designed to allow both external and internal key generation as follows:
     * 
     * If no keying material is supplied, then the algorithm MAY be recognized
     * and a key can be generated internally. This is only done if a KeyEncryptionParams
     * structure is also supplied to the operation (otherwise the key would be lost).
     * 
     * If an XSECCryptoKey is supplied, then it is used directly, but if KeyEncryptionParams
     * are supplied, an exception will result unless the raw key buffer is also supplied.
     * 
     * If a raw key is provided, then a key object can also be created internally if the
     * algorithm is recognized.
     * 
     * Summing up, if KeyEncryptionParams are used, a raw key must be available or the
     * key can be generated when the encryption algorithm itself is a standard one. If
     * no KeyEncryptionParams are supplied, then the key must be supplied either in raw
     * or object form.
